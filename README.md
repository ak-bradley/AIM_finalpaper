Indentity &amp; Access Management incident report

This coursework consists of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) incident report based on a fictional scenario at AcmeDataCorp, a mid-sized company operating in the financial sector. 
The organization handles sensitive customer data, internal financial documentation, and critical IT systems, making strong access control and identity governance essential.

The assignment places the student in the role of a security analyst tasked with analyzing six serious security incidents related to IAM failures. The environment is built around a role-based access control (RBAC)
model using defined roles such as Finance, HR, IT-Admins, Managers, and Interns, combined with discretionary access control through DACLs and security logging via SACLs. Authentication relies on password policies
with mandatory MFA for privileged users and logging of successful and failed login attempts.

The report begins with a structured description of the IAM environment, outlining roles, protected resources, authentication methods, access models, and relevant threat scenarios. This establishes the context 
required to properly assess the incidents.

The main part of the work analyzes six distinct incidents involving excessive privileges, failed offboarding, suspicious login behavior, geographic anomalies, improper data placement, and privilege escalation 
through misconfigured delegation. Each incident is examined from an IAM perspective, focusing on violated principles such as least privilege, separation of duties, and need-to-know, as well as potential business 
and security impacts. Expected logging and monitoring evidence is also discussed.

The assignment concludes with a risk analysis that highlights systemic weaknesses in privilege management, lifecycle handling, authentication enforcement, and monitoring. Concrete improvement proposals are presented, 
covering IAM policy refinement, privileged access management, improved onboarding and offboarding processes, stronger authentication controls, and enhanced logging and monitoring practices.

The focus of the coursework is analytical reasoning and security principles rather than technical configuration steps, demonstrating an understanding of IAM concepts, risks, and mitigation strategies in a 
realistic enterprise context.
